# Day 04 – Beginner

## Randomisation and Python Lists

### Overview

Day 4 focused on understanding how randomness works in Python and how lists can be used to store, access, and manipulate collections of data. I practiced using the `random` module along with Python lists to build simple interactive programs.

---

### Topics I Covered

* Importing and using the `random` module
* Generating random numbers
* Python lists and list indexing
* Storing multiple values in a list
* Accessing list elements using index positions
* Combining randomisation with lists

---

### Concepts I Practiced

* Using `random.randint()` and `random.choice()`
* Creating and managing lists
* Mapping user input to list indexes
* Building logic based on random outcomes

---

### What I Learned

* How Python generates random values
* How lists store ordered collections of data
* How index positions work in lists
* How randomness can be used to simulate real-world scenarios
* Writing cleaner code by grouping related data into lists
