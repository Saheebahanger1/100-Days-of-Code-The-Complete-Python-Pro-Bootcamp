# Day 07 – Beginner

## Hangman Project

## Overview

On **Day 7** of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I built the classic **Hangman game** using Python.
This project helped me combine multiple programming concepts into a complete, interactive command-line game.

---

## Project Objective

To create a Hangman game where:

* The computer randomly selects a word
* The player guesses letters one at a time
* Incorrect guesses reduce available lives
* The game ends when the word is guessed or lives run out

---

## Concepts I Covered

* Lists and strings
* `for` and `while` loops
* Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* User input handling
* Random word selection
* Game state management
* ASCII art for visual feedback

---

## What I Learned

* How to structure a complete Python game
* Managing game logic with loops and conditions
* Updating display output dynamically
* Tracking user progress and mistakes
* Handling repeated guesses correctly
* Writing cleaner and more readable code

---

## Game Features

* Randomly chosen word
* Letter-by-letter guessing
* Visual hangman stages using ASCII art
* Life tracking system
* Win and lose conditions

---

## 📂 Files Included

* `Day7.py` – Main Hangman game logic & Ascii art
