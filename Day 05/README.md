# Day 05 – Beginner

## Python Loops

### Overview

Day 5 focused on understanding and applying **loops in Python** to automate repetitive tasks. I practiced using `for` loops with lists and ranges, learned how to accumulate values, and built a password generator using loop-based logic.

---

### Topics I Covered

* `for` loops in Python
* Iterating over lists
* Using the `range()` function
* Accumulators for summation
* Finding maximum values using loops
* Randomization with loops
* Password generation logic

---

### Concepts I Practiced

* Looping through collections
* Repeating tasks efficiently
* Using counters and accumulators
* Comparing values inside loops
* Combining loops with the `random` module

---

### What I Learned

* How loops reduce code repetition
* Difference between iterating over lists and ranges
* How to calculate totals using loops
* How to determine maximum values manually
* How loops can be used to build real-world programs like password generators
