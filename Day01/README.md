# Day 01 – Beginner  
## Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

###  Overview
On Day 1, I learned the fundamentals of Python programming by working with variables and basic data handling.
This day I focused on understanding how data is stored, manipulated, and displayed using Python.

---

###  Topics I Covered
- Printing output using `print()`
- Taking user input with `input()`
- Declaring and using variables
- String concatenation
- Basic data types (`str`, `int`)
- Naming conventions for variables

---

###  Concepts I Practiced
- Storing user input in variables
- Displaying formatted output
- Managing simple data flows in a program

---

###  What I Learned
- How variables act as containers for data
- How Python handles text (strings)
- How to interact with users via the console
- Importance of meaningful variable names

---

###  Files in This Folder
- `day1.py` – Python code demonstrating variables and input/output operations

###  Next Steps
Moving forward, I’ll build on these basics by learning data types, type conversion, and control flow.
