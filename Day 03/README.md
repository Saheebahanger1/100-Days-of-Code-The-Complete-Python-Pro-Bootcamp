# Day 03 – Beginner

## Control Flow and Logical Operators

### Overview

Day 3 focused on controlling the flow of a Python program using conditional statements and logical operators. I learned how programs make decisions based on conditions and how multiple conditions can be combined to control execution paths.

---

### Topics I Covered

* Conditional statements:

  * `if`
  * `elif`
  * `else`
* Comparison operators:

  * `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* Logical operators:

  * `and`
  * `or`
  * `not`
* Nested conditions
* Indentation and code blocks

---

### Concepts I Practiced

* Writing decision-based programs
* Evaluating multiple conditions
* Combining logical expressions
* Handling different outcomes using conditional logic

---

### What I Learned

* How Python executes code conditionally
* How logical operators help combine multiple checks
* Importance of correct indentation in control flow
* Writing readable and efficient conditional logic
