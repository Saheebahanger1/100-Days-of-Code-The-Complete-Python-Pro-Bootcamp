# Day 12 – Beginner

## Scope & Number Guessing Game

## Overview

On **Day 12** of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I learned about **variable scope in Python** and applied this knowledge by building a **Number Guessing Game**.

This day focused on understanding how variables behave inside and outside functions and how scope affects program logic.

---

## Project Objective

* Understand local vs global scope
* Learn how Python handles variable lifetime
* Build a number guessing game using scoped variables
* Apply logic using functions and loops

---

## Concepts I Covered

* Local scope
* Global scope
* Function scope
* Block scope behavior in Python
* Constants
* Using scope in game logic
* Random number generation

---

## What I Learned

* Difference between local and global variables
* How scope prevents unintended variable modification
* When to use global variables carefully
* How scope improves code safety and readability
* Structuring game logic with functions

---

## Number Guessing Game Features

* Random number selection
* Easy and hard difficulty levels
* Limited attempts based on difficulty
* Feedback for high/low guesses
* Win and lose conditions
