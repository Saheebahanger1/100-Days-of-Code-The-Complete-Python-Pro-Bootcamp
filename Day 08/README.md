# Day 08 – Beginner

## Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher 

## Overview 

On **Day 8** of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I learned how to work with **function parameters and arguments** and applied these concepts by building the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption program.

This day focused on writing reusable functions and understanding how data flows into and out of them.

---

## Project Objective

* Understand how function parameters work
* Learn the difference between positional and keyword arguments
* Build a Caesar Cipher program that can:
  * Encrypt text
  * Decrypt text
  * Shift letters based on a user-defined value

---

## Concepts I Covered 

* Defining functions with parameters
* Passing arguments to functions
* Positional vs keyword arguments
* String manipulation
* Loops and conditional logic
* Modular and reusable code
* Basic cryptography logic (Caesar Cipher)

---

## What I Learned 

* How parameters make functions flexible and reusable
* How to avoid code repetition using functions
* How to manipulate strings character by character
* How encryption and decryption logic works
* How to handle user input safely

---

## Caesar Cipher Features 

* Encrypt and decrypt messages
* Custom shift values
* Handles wrap-around from `z` to `a`
* User-friendly command-line interaction
