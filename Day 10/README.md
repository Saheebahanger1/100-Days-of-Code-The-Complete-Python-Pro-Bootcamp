# Day 10 – Beginner
## Functions with Outputs

## Overview

On Day 10 of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I learned how to create functions that return values and used them to build more dynamic and reusable Python programs.

This day focused on transforming input data into meaningful output through well-structured functions.

---

Project Objective

* Understand the `return` statement in Python
* Learn how functions send data back to the caller
* Build programs that rely on function outputs instead of print statements
* Apply logic using returned values

---

Concepts I Covered

* Functions with return values
* Difference between print and return
* Using returned data in calculations
* Multiple return paths
* Clean and modular function design
* Docstrings and code readability

---

What I Learned

* How return ends function execution
* Why returning values makes functions reusable
* How to chain functions together
* How to handle different outcomes using return values
* Writing clearer and more maintainable code
