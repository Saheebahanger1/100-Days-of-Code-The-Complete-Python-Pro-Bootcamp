# Day 02 – Beginner  
## Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

### Overview
Day 2 focused on learning Python’s core data types and how to work with strings. I explored how Python handles different types of data and practiced manipulating text using built-in functions and indexing.

---

### Topics I Covered
- Python primitive data types:
  - String (`str`)
  - Integer (`int`)
  - Float (`float`)
  - Boolean (`bool`)
- Type checking with `type()`
- Type conversion (casting)
- String indexing and slicing
- String concatenation
- Escape characters
- f-Strings (formatted strings)

---

### Concepts I Practiced
- Converting data types using `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Accessing individual characters in strings
- Formatting output using f-strings
- Handling user input and converting it to required types

---

### What I Learned
- Difference between various data types in Python
- Why type conversion is important
- How to manipulate and format strings efficiently
- How Python treats user input as strings by default
