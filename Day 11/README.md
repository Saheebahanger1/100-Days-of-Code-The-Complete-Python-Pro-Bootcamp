# Day 11 – Beginner
## The Blackjack Capstone Project

### Overview

On Day 11 of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I built a command-line **Blackjack game**.

This capstone project combined everything learned so far into a complete, logic-driven program that simulates the classic casino game.

---

### Project Objective

* Build a playable Blackjack game in Python
* Apply functions, loops, conditionals, and lists together
* Implement real-world game rules and logic
* Handle win, lose, and draw scenarios correctly

---

### Concepts Covered

* Functions and return values
* Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
* Lists and list operations
* Random card selection
* Loops and game flow control
* Game state comparison logic

---

### What I Learned

* How to break a complex project into smaller functions
* Implementing Blackjack scoring rules
* Handling special cases (Ace as 1 or 11)
* Managing multiple game outcomes
* Writing readable and modular Python code

---

### Game Features

* Random card dealing
* Automatic dealer behavior
* Ace value adjustment (1 or 11)
* Player decision to hit or stand
* Win, lose, and draw conditions
