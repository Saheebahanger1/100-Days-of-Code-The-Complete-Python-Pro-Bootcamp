# Day 09 – Beginner

## Dictionaries, Nesting & the Secret Auction

## Overview

On Day 9 of my **100 Days of Code – The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, I explored **Python dictionaries**, learned how to **nest data structures**, and applied these concepts by building the **Secret Auction program**.

This day focused on organizing and managing structured data efficiently.

## Project Objective

* Understand Python dictionaries and key-value pairs
* Learn how to nest dictionaries and lists
* Build a Secret Auction program that:
  * Collects bids anonymously
  * Stores bidder names and bid values
  * Determines the highest bidder automatically

---

## Concepts I Covered

* Python dictionaries
* Accessing and modifying dictionary values
* Nesting dictionaries inside lists and vice versa
* Iterating over dictionaries
* Using loops and conditional logic
* Clearing the screen for privacy (auction use case)

---

## What I Learned

* How dictionaries differ from lists
* When to use dictionaries instead of lists
* How to structure complex data using nesting
* How to loop through dictionaries effectively
* How to implement real-world logic using data structures

---

## Secret Auction Features

* Anonymous bidding system
* Multiple participants
* Automatic highest bid calculation
* Clean and readable output
