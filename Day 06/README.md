# Day 06 – Beginner  
## Python Functions & Karel (Reeborg's World)

### Overview
Day 6 focused on understanding **Python functions** and **while loops**, and applying them to solve logic-based problems using **Karel / Reeborg’s World**. I learned how breaking code into reusable functions makes programs easier to read, debug, and scale.

---

### Topics I Covered
- Defining and calling functions
- Function reusability
- `while` loops
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Conditional logic inside loops
- Problem-solving with Karel (Reeborg’s World)

---

### Concepts I Practiced
- Creating custom functions
- Using `while` loops to repeat actions
- Combining functions with conditions
- Writing clean and readable logic
- Applying algorithms to maze and hurdle problems

---

### Karel / Reeborg Challenges Solved
- **Hurdle 4** – Jumping obstacles using loops and functions
- **Maze Escape** – Navigating a maze using the right-hand rule algorithm

---

### What I Learned
- Why functions improve code readability and reusability
- How `while` loops differ from `for` loops
- How to solve problems when the number of steps is unknown
- How to think logically and break problems into smaller steps
- How algorithms guide movement-based problems

### Next Steps
Next, I’ll work with **control flow and logic-based challenges** to further strengthen my problem-solving skills.
